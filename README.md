DESCRPTION:  
Here is the beginning frame work to my new portfolio page!

built outside of class. I hope to continue cleaning this up and  
improving it over the course of our class.

User Story  
AS AN employer  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a   good candidate for an open position  
  
Acceptance Criteria  
IVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
